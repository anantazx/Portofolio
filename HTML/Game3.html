        <h3 class="part_header">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>The Lost Merchant</strong> is a survival adventure game that I developed as part of my final project. This project challenged me to design an immersive survival experience where players must <strong>endure one full in-game day, balancing resource management, combat, and strategic decision-making to stay alive</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Players take on the role of a lost merchant who finds themselves stranded in a hostile environment filled with unpredictable dangers. To survive, they must <strong>gather resources, and fend off relentless attacks from wild animals using either ranged combat (bow) or melee attacks (iron sword)</strong>. The game emphasizes critical thinking and adaptability, requiring players to carefully manage their limited resources to sustain themselves until safety is secured.
        </p>

        <h3 class="part_header">Survival Mechanics</h3>

        <p>
            Players must carefully strategize <strong>resource management</strong> to survive one full in-game day in a <strong>hostile environment</strong>. Gathering essential supplies such as <strong>food, water, and materials</strong> is crucial to maintaining health and stamina. Every decision impacts survival—players must prioritize resources wisely, choosing between immediate consumption for sustenance or long-term planning for sustained survival.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to managing resources, players must be mindful of environmental threats and adapt to changing conditions. Whether hunting for <strong>food, or finding shelter</strong>, each action plays a vital role in ensuring survival until the day ends. The game challenges players to think strategically, balancing risk and reward to maximize their chances of endurance.

        <h3 class="part_header">Challenging Environment</h3>

        <p>
            The game presents a <strong>hostile and unpredictable environment</strong> where players must constantly adapt and strategize to survive. tigers roam the area, posing a constant threat that requires players to stay alert and manage their combat approach wisely—whether engaging in ranged attacks with a <strong>bow</strong> or opting for close combat with an <strong>iron sword</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond combat, the environment itself introduces various <strong>survival challenges</strong>, such as <strong>limited resources, changing weather conditions, and hidden dangers</strong>. Players must explore cautiously, make strategic decisions, and utilize their surroundings effectively to overcome obstacles and endure the harsh survival experience.

        <h3 class="part_header">Limited Resources</h3>

        <p>
            In The Lost Merchant, survival is not just about combat skills but also about managing scarce resources wisely. Players must carefully <strong>gather, conserve, and utilize essential supplies such as food, water, weapons</strong> to sustain themselves throughout one full in-game day. Every action matters—choosing when to consume resources for immediate survival or save them for potential future threats can determine success or failure.
